Bulla Network enables the on-chain creation of credit pools for invoice factoring. By adhering to the ERC4626 specification, permissioned depositors can earn interest for facilitating invoice funding. Through these contracts, invoice issuers can factor their receivables, allowing them to receive early payments in exchange for a premium. This integration not only broadens the utility of the Bulla Claim Protocol but also provides a new financial mechanism for liquidity and credit management on-chain.
